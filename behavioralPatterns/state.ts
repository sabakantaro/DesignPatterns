/**
 * State Pattern
 */

// Overview
// State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

// Why use it?
// Use the State pattern when you have an object that behaves differently depending on its current state, the number of states is enormous, and the state-specific code changes frequently. 
// Use the pattern when you have a class polluted with massive conditionals that alter how the class behaves according to the current values of the classâ€™s fields.
// Use the State when you have a lot of duplicate code across similar states and transitions of a condition-based state machine.

// Pros:
// Single Responsibility Principle. Organize the code related to particular states into separate classes.
// Open/Closed Principle. Introduce new states without changing existing state classes or the context.
// Simplify the code of the context by eliminating bulky state machine conditionals.

// Cons:
// Applying the pattern can be overkill if a state machine has only a few states or rarely changes.
// The pattern requires creating several new classes which can be confusing.
