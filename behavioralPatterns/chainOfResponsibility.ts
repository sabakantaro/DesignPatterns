/**
 * Chain of Responsibility
 */

// Overview:
// Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

// Why use it?
// Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when you want to give more than one object a chance to handle a request. For example, if you want to implement a logging system, you could use a chain of loggers, each of which specializes in a different logging task.
// Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when itâ€™s essential to execute several handlers in a particular order.
// Use the pattern when the set of handlers and their order are supposed to change at runtime.

// Pros:
// You can control the order of request handling.
// Single Responsibility Principle. You can decouple classes that invoke operations from classes that perform operations.
// Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new handlers into the app without breaking the existing client code.

// Cons:
// Some requests may end up unhandled.
