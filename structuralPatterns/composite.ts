/**
 * Composite Pattern
 */

// Overview
// Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

// Why use it?
// Use the Composite pattern when you have to implement a tree-like object structure.
// Use the pattern when you want the client code to treat both simple and complex elements uniformly.

// Pros:
// You can work with complex tree structures more conveniently: use polymorphism and recursion to your advantage.
// Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new element types into the app without breaking the existing code, which now works with the object tree.

// Cons:
// It might be difficult to provide a common interface for classes whose functionality differs too much. In certain scenarios, youâ€™d need to overgeneralize the component interface, making it harder to comprehend.
