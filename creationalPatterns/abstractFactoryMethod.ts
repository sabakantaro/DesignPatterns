/**
 * Abstract Factory Method
 */

// Overview:
// Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

// Why use it?
// Abstract Factory is very similar to Factory Method. The main difference between these two patterns is that Factory Method is a single method, and Abstract Factory is an object. Abstract Factory groups individual factories that have a common theme.

// Pros:
// You can be sure that the products youâ€™re getting from a factory are compatible with each other.
// You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.
// Single Responsibility Principle. You can extract the product creation code into one place, making the code easier to support.
// Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.

// Cons:
// The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern.
